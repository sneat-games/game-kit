// Turn clock: the two deadlines that bound a turn, and the bids a player's
// own client submits on their behalf when one expires.
//
// Both deadlines are SELF-ENFORCED. A client only ever auto-submits its own
// move, through exactly the same commit-reveal path a manual move takes.
// Neither peer ever resolves a turn on the other's behalf, so a timeout can
// never make the two boards disagree.
//
//   - Once one player's bid is in, the other has LATE_BID_MS to answer.
//     Failing that their bid defaults to LATE_BID_DEFAULT (0), so the only
//     real bid wins the turn — and, under the first-price-transfer rule, is
//     paid to the player who did not answer.
//
//   - If NEITHER player has bid STALL_MS after the turn started, each silent
//     client submits `stallBid` (see below). Without this a vs-friend turn
//     with two idle players would hang forever.
//
// The LATE_BID_MS clock replaces the STALL_MS one as soon as either bid
// lands. Both are session-layer rules: the auction core (`resolveAuction`)
// only ever sees the two final bids, so neither it nor this module knows or
// cares whether a bid arrived from a click or from a clock expiring.
//
// Ported verbatim from bidding-tictactoe/web/src/ui/turn-clock.ts — the
// rules and their rationale are game-agnostic as written.
